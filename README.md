## Example 1: *Hello world*

To get started let's make a small addon which is the C++ equivalent of
the following JavaScript code:

```js
module.exports.hello = function() { return 'world'; };
```

### Step 1

First we need to set up an npm-compatible package. Use `npm init` in a new directory to create the skeleton *package.json*.

### Step 2

Next we need to install **[NAN](https://github.com/rvagg/nan)**. NAN will serve as a thin abstraction layer between the C++ code we write and the Node and V8 APIs so that we can target multiple versions of Node without worrying too much about the changing V8 or Node APIs. Run `npm install nan@latest --save` to install NAN and save it as a `"dependency"` in your *package.json*.

### Step 3

All Node addons are compiled using the **[GYP](http://code.google.com/p/gyp/wiki/GypUserDocumentation)** build tool via **[node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp)**. Add a `"gypfile": true` entry to your *package.json* so that npm knows this is a binary addon that needs compiling and it needs to invoke node-gyp. When node-gyp is invoked, it looks for a *binding.gyp* file in the same directory as your *package.json*. This file is written in YAML and describes the particulars of your build, including the source files and any binary dependencies. node-gyp will invoke GYP with your *binding.gyp* and also the [common.gypi](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/common.gypi) settings file found in the source of the version of Node it is invoked with. Because your code will be compiled against the Node source and it requires the common.gypi file for that source, it must also download the complete tarball of the particular release you are running. These tarballs are stored in ~/.node-gyp/ so they only need to be installed once.

Create a *binding.gyp* file with the following contents:

```yaml
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "target_name": "hello",
      "sources": [ "hello.cc" ],
      "include_dirs": [
        "<!(node -e \"require('nan')\")"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This file tells GYP the following things:

 1. The binary output target is called "hello", we will end up with a "hello.node" file either in ./build/Release/ or ./build/Debug/ depending on how node-gyp is invoked and your environment variables.
 1. The only source file to compile is "hello.cc" in the same directory as the *binding.gyp*.
 1. When compiling, the directory containing NAN needs to be used as an "include", i.e. compile with -Ipath/to/NAN. The NAN path is found by executing the command `node -e "require('nan')"` (try running this from the command-line!).

### Step 4

Now write some code!
First we create a file `hello.cc` and the following contents:

```c++
#include <nan.h>

using namespace v8;

NAN_METHOD(Method) {
  NanScope();
  NanReturnValue(String::New("world"));
}

void Init(Handle<Object> exports) {
  exports->Set(NanSymbol("hello"), FunctionTemplate::New(Method)->GetFunction());
}

NODE_MODULE(hello, Init)
```

This code contains three main components, starting from the bottom:

```c++
NODE_MODULE(hello, Init)
```

This code defines the entry-point for the Node addon, it tells Node where to go once the library has been loaded into active memory. The first argument **must match the "target" in our *binding.gyp***. The second argument points to the function to invoke.

```c++
void Init(Handle<Object> exports) {
  exports->Set(NanSymbol("hello"), FunctionTemplate::New(Method)->GetFunction());
}
```

This code is our entry-point. We can receive up to two arguments here, the first is `exports`, the same as `module.exports` in a .js file and the second argument (omitted in this case) is `module` which is the same as `module` in a .js file. Normally you would attach properties to `exports` but you can use the `module` argument to *replace* its `exports` property so you are exporting a single thing, the equivalent of: `module.exports = function () { ... }`.

In our case we just want to attach a `"hello"` property to `module.exports` so we set a V8 `String` property to a V8 `Function` object. We use the `NanSymbol()` function to create a "symbol" string that we may reuse in future, so generally you should use these for object properties and other repeatable symbols. We use a V8 `FunctionTemplate` to turn a regular (but compatible) C++ function into a V8-callable function. In this case, the `Method` function.

```c++
NAN_METHOD(Method) {
  NanScope();
  NanReturnValue(String::New("world"));
}
```

This is where NAN first comes in useful for us. The changing V8 API has made it difficult to target different versions of Node with the same C++ code so NAN helps provide a simple mapping so we can define a V8 compatible function that `FunctionTemplate` will accept. In recent versions of V8, `NAN_METHOD(Method)` would expand to: `void Method(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value>& args)` which is the standard signature for a function that can be called by V8. The `args` parameter contains call information, such as JavaScript function parameters, and allows us to set return values.

`NanScope()` is used here to set a V8 "handle scope" which is much like the function-scope in JavaScript. It defines the lifetime for which any created "handles" are safe from the garbage collector. When we use this at the top of our function we are declaring that any V8 object we create should live for the life of that function. If we omit the handle scope then created objects may attach to the global scope and may end up not being garbage collected, leading to a memory leak.

`NanReturnValue()` sets the return value for our function. In this case we are creating a simple V8 `String` object with the contents `"world"`, this will be exposed as a standard JavaScript `String` with the value `"world"`. Since this object is created within the handle scope we declared above, its freedom from garbage collection will be lost as soon as it leaves our function *unless* it is referenced by another function, either in JavaScript or in a new handle scope in our C++. In our case we will be printing the string so it will be attached to a new scope in our JavaScript code.

### Step 5

Compile your addon: if you don't have `node-gyp` installed, use `sudo npm install node-gyp -g` to install it. It comes bundled with npm but is not normally linked as an executable in your `PATH` so it's best to install it separately.

Run `node-gyp configure` to set up the build fixtures. In the *./build/* directory, a *Makefile* and associated property files will be created on Unix systems and a *vcxproj* file will be created on Windows.

Next, run `node-gyp build` to start the build process and watch your addon compile. You can use `node-gyp build` again to incrementally recompile changed source files. Alternatively you can use `node-gyp rebuild` to combine the `configure` and `build` steps in one.

You should now have a compiled binary addon ready for use. Node will load it just like it loads a .js module file and include it in your running application. The binary file should be be located at *./build/Release/hello.node*.

### Step 6

Write some JavaScript!

Create a file called *hello.js* with the following contents:

```js
var addon = require('./build/Release/hello.node');

console.log(addon.hello());
```

The first line is responsible for loading our compiled add-on and pulling in the exports to our module. The path may substitute Debug for Release if you have run node-gyp with the `--debug` flag or you have used another method to signal to GYP that this should be a debug build.

The best approach to this uncertainty of where the module file is located is to pull in an additional dependency, **[node-bindings](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-bindings)** which will locate the binary for you, use it like so:

```js
var addon = require('bindings')('hello.node')
```

The invocation of our addon comes from `console.log(addon.hello())` where we fetch the `Method` function in our C++ code and execute it. It returns a `"hello"` String which is printed to the console.

The [nan](./nan/) directory contains a complete copy of this example. Run `npm install` and `node hello.js` to compile and run the code.

The [node_0.10](./node_0.10/) directory contains a version of the example without NAN, compatible with Node 0.10 and prior (only).

The [node_0.12](./node_0.12/) directory contains a version of the example without NAN, compatible with Node 0.11 and above (only).
